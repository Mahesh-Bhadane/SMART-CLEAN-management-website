This project of SMART CLEAN is very simple and useful software. It helps to perform operations like Save, Update, Delete, Clear and Search on Forms in the software.

Concerning the need of Digital involvement in daily practices we dreamt if it is possible to develop such project which gives step ahead to bio converters.
So, we decided to design this Digital technique, that can be transformed into waste management system via registering in Computational database system to users and providing smart setups to waste-collectors (Collection Trucks). 
Considering the efficiency factors, we will provide Location-based waste collection services on request of all the areas on daily basis.
After Collecting waste from all the areas without using worms and other method we find new method called "Harmetia Sanitizing Bioconverter" 
which produce Black Soldier Fly Larvae. Basically, this model is useful for Establishing & Building larvae colonies.
The Black Solider Flies to lay eggs in small holes over the grub bin. The BSF holes much promise for converting low-value manures
& many other organic “Wastes” into a valuable commodity. In this way amount of waste products or garbage is reduced. 

Also, this software provide Graphical user interface that make you use this software with ease, 
this help user to do their work in less time, and with great efficiency.
